Description: A consistent package easy to extend implementing common routines
            for analyzing ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) measurements, as well as samples
            from multicapillary columns coupled with IMS (MCC-IMS) and gas chromatography
            coupled to ion mobility spectrometry (GC-IMS). The package provides a complete
            workflow for the analysis, importing the data, preprocessing the spectra
            as well as classification andregression techniques for the modelling of the spectra.
