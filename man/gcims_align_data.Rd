\title{Sample alignment in drift and retention time axes}
\usage{
gcims_align_data(dir_in, dir_out, samples, alignment_data)
}
\arguments{
\item{dir_in}{Input directory. Where input data files are loaded
from.}

\item{dir_out}{Output directory. Where aligned data files are stored.}

\item{samples}{Numeric vector of integers. Identifies the set of
sample to be visualized from the dataset.}

\item{alignment_data}{A list containing two matrices: tis and rics, the Total
Ion Spectra and Reactant Ion Chromatograns of data.}
}
\value{
A set of S3 objects. Additionally, it returns a list containing the correction
factors in drift time (Kcorr_samples, a vector with as many components as samples), the reference
Reactant Ion Chromatogram (ric_ref), and correction type for retention time alignment (correction_type).
The output a variable correction_type is a whole number between 0 and 5. If 0, no correction is applied.
Between 1 and 5 it the optimal degree of the polynomial that corrects retention time axis.
}
\description{
This alignment function corrects misalignments in drift and retention
time axes. In drift time, the correction is multiplicative, meaning:
drift_time_corr = Kcorr * drift_time. The constant Kcorr is obtained
by correcting the position of the Reactant Ion Peak (RIP) in a sample
to make it coincide with the reference position of the RIP (the median position
of all RIPs in the dataset). Changes in pressure and temperature
during measurements may lead to correction factors between 0.9 and 1.1.
measurements are not available. The correction in retention time performed
using parametric time warping. The warping function is optimized by searching
the polynomial degree (between 1 and 5) that maximizes the average
correlation between the reference RIC (Reactant Ion Chromatogram) and each of
the individual samples.
