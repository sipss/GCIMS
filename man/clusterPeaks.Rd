\usage{
clusterPeaks(
  peaks,
  ...,
  distance_method = "euclidean",
  dt_cluster_spread_ms = 0.7,
  rt_cluster_spread_s = 7,
  distance_between_peaks_from_same_sample = 100,
  clustering = list(method = "kmedoids", Nclusters = "max_peaks_sample"),
  verbose = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{peaks}{A data frame with at least the following columns:
\itemize{
\item "UniqueID" A unique ID for each peak
\item "SampleID" The sample ID the peak belongs to
\item "dt_apex_ms", "rt_apex_s" The peak positions
\item "dt_max_ms", "dt_min_ms", "rt_max_s", "rt_min_s" (for filtering outlier peaks based on their size)
}}

\item{...}{Ignored. All other parameters beyond \code{peaks} should be named}

\item{distance_method}{A string. One of the distance methods from \link[stats:dist]{stats::dist}, "sd_scaled_euclidean" or "mahalanobis"}

\item{dt_cluster_spread_ms, rt_cluster_spread_s}{The typical spread of the clusters. Used for scaling
dimensions when computing distances}

\item{distance_between_peaks_from_same_sample}{The distance between two peaks from the same sample will be set to \code{distance_between_peaks_from_same_sample*max(distance_matrix)}}

\item{clustering}{A named list with "method" and the supported method, as well as further options.
For \code{method = "kmedoids"}, you must provide \code{Nclusters}, with either the number of clusters
to use in the kmedoids algorithm (\link[cluster:pam]{cluster::pam}) or the string \code{"max_peaks_sample"} to use the maximum number of
detected peaks per sample.

For \code{method = "hclust"}, you can provide \code{hclust_method}, with the \code{method} passed to \link[stats:hclust]{stats::hclust}.}

\item{verbose}{logical, to control printing in the function}
}
\value{
A list with :
\itemize{
\item peak_table: A peak table that includes peak position, median peak minimum/maximum retention and drift times and the peak Volume for each sample
\item peak_table_duplicity: How many Volume values have been aggregated. Should be 1 for each sample/peak
\item extra_clustering_info: Arbitrary clustering extra information, that depends on the clustering method
}
}
\description{
Peak grouping function, exposing several options useful for benchmarking.
