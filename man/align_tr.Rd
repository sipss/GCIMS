\title{Correction of retention time axis using Parametric Time Warping (PTW)}
\usage{
align_tr(dir_in, dir_out, samples, correction_type)
}
\arguments{
\item{dir_in}{Input directory. Where input data files are loaded
from.}

\item{dir_out}{Output directory. Where aligned data files are stored.}

\item{samples}{Numeric vector of integers. Identifies the set of
sample to be visualized from the dataset.}

\item{correction_type}{Numeric. Integer between 0 and 5. If zero, no correction
in retention time is needed. Between 1 and 5 it indicates
the polynomial degree of the warping function.}
}
\description{
This chromatrogram computes the RIC of the reference samples and
uses it to correct each of the EIC of a sample, for the all the selected
samples on the dataset. The warping function that relates the
retention time axes of the reference and the sample to be corrected
is linear.
