  Arguments passed on to \code{\link[=findPeaksImpl]{findPeaksImpl}}
  \describe{
    \item{\code{verbose}}{If \code{TRUE} information will be printed on screen}
    \item{\code{dt_length_ms,rt_length_s}}{Length of the filters used to compute the
second derivative. See details. FIXME (experimental): You can set both
\code{dt_length_ms} and \code{rt_length_s} to \code{-1} if you want to use the raw signal
for the peak detection instead of the second derivatives.}
    \item{\code{dt_peakwidth_range_ms,rt_peakwidth_range_s}}{A vector of length 2 with the minimum and maximum peak width. See details}
    \item{\code{exclude_rip}}{Whether to exclude ROIs with a drift time apex smaller than the RIP drift time end.}
    \item{\code{iou_overlap_threshold}}{A number, between 0 and 1. Pairs of ROIs with an intersection over union larger than this threshold are merged.}
